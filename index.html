<!-- This resume was adapted from a course at UDacity by Greg Ford.  Much of the original commenting was intentionally left in place for context. -->
<!-- This version is a second generation edit of the material that was handed in for the resume course.  It now demonstrates the separation of concerns concept. -->

This is an HTML document. It contains information about how elements in the website
are arranged. In other words, it describes the layout of a website.

I can't wait to see the resumes you put together!

The next line tells the browser where to download the JavaScript file you'll be
writing. In resumeBuilder.js, you'll be writing code that builds the resume
dynamically when this website, index.html, is opened.

These scripts are written in JavaScript. You'll be breaking them down as part of
a quiz. Essentially, the next few lines are checking to see if you have not
changed each section of the resume. If you have not made any changes to a section
of the resume, then that part of the resume does not show up. More on this in the
course.
